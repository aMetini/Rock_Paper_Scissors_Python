# Python_Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic rock-scissors-bag game in Python. In this game, the computer randomly selects one of the three options (rock, scissors, or bag), and the player also chooses one. The choices are then displayed simultaneously, and the winner is determined based on the following rules:

Rock wins over scissors
Scissors wins over bag
Bag wins over rock
If both the computer and the player choose the same option, the result is a tie.

The player continues to play until either winning or losing to the computer.
